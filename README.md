# Meal Planner

Meal planner is a tool to aid you in figuring out what to eat and plan your meals as well as provide means to help you do your grocery shopping by providing a shopping list based on the recipes you have added. 
  
## Technology

The project is built with React primarily because it is the current market leader for front-end web frameworks [1] with a slight lead over vue.js in both prevalence on the market as well as satisfaction ratings by developers. Angular, another popular front-end framework, has seen a decrease in popularity the past couple of years.

The suitability of several frameworks was also taken into consideration when making the choice. With regards to this, Angular was discarded primarily because it is said to have a pretty steep learning curve [2], and the duration of this project was comparatively short.
 
 In short, React was chosen because of its leading prevalence on the market, ease of access and community support.
